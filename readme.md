This is a repository containing my solutions to some leetcode problems. I don't
actually like leetcode very much, but every now and then I feel like doing one
or two. I make use of [leetgo](https://github.com/j178/leetgo) as a testing
framework, to automate acquiring and submitting problems.

## Usage

You can either use the `.yaml` file provided in this repository, or create your
own by running `leetgo init` after entering the nix shell. Speaking of, I make
use of a flake to manage some basic dependencies for the testing environment.
Not everything I use is present in this flake, but everything you "need" is
included. Neovim, for exmaple, is not included in the flake as I didn't want to
override my configuration from outside the shell while inside the shell.
